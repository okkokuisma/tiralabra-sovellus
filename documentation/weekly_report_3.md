# Week 3

## What have I done this week
I planned on implementing Huffman coding into my project this week but I didn't quite get there. I managed to finish the encoding part of the algorithm but I'll have to finish the decoding algorithm next week. Encoding seems to work but I have no tests to prove it at the moment. I'll get there. Also implemented the first data structures: heap which I'll use in the Huffman algorithm and an array list structure for storing bytes. The code for the array list structure is coded quite a while ago (by me of course) and needs testing as well. 

## Progress so far
At the moment I have a LZSS algorithm, bit manipulation class, a couple of data structures and quite a bit of Huffman coding done.

## What have I learned this week
Mostly more about Huffman coding. I like the algorithm: it's simple and elegant. Also had to brush up some things about heaps and trees.

## Problems so far
Nothing pressing at the moment. I have ideas on how to improve the bit manipulation and the compression rate. Having said that, both of my main algorithms are coded to "just work" at the moment. There are some clumsy bits and some not so efficient bits that I have to change still. Overall I'm feeling like I have the project under control.

## What will I do next
I need to up my testing, up my documentation, finish the Huffman algorithm and tidy up some of the clumsiness.

## Hours spent this week
Roughly 13.
