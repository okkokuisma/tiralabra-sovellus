# Week 6

## What have I done this week
I have added quite a bit of new functionality to my program. Coded a more efficient LZSS algorithm which uses queues to store every instance of each byte value in the sliding window. Evolved ByteList to IntegerQueue. Added a whole new algorithm called DeflateLite which combines LZSS and Huffman coding in a way that kinda imitates Deflate in a simple way, hence the "Lite". Also added a bit to the documentation.

## Progress so far
I think my compression algorithms are quite close to being finished. Might still look into even more efficient data structures but that's just polishing things up. I've still been lazy with tests and documentation so there's still work to be done.

## What have I learned this week
Nothing completely new. The time was spent modifying what was already there so that things would work better as a whole. And I got to implement some of the things I learned while researching Deflate.

## Problems so far
None.

## What will I do next
The demo is quite near so I think I'll start to code some kind of an UI. I have an idea of some kind of a GUI with a drag-and-drop functionality in my mind but we'll see. 

## Hours spent this week
About 21
